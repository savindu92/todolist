# Simple PHP todolist, school project

## You are required to create a shared Todo list capable of managing tasks. As a user of your Todo list, I want to be able to:

-View my Todo list

-View a single task from my Todo list

-Add a task to my Todo list

-Modify the content of a task in my Todo list

-Mark a task as completed

-Delete a task from my Todo list

## Each task in my Todo list should consist of:

-Title (required)

-Description (optional)

-Assigned to (person responsible)

-Creation date

-The project should be developed in a group of 2 or a maximum of 3 members (no solo projects).

Please note that the project should be implemented using the PHP programming language.
Feel free to ask if you have any further questions.
